	<h2> My Favourite Movie: Hairspray (2007) </h2>
	<p> Hairspray is a movie about an overnight dancing sensation, Tracy, on the "Corny Collins" show. Tracy's main goal is to bring racial integration to the foreground on television. I appreciate that this movie discusses hard to deal with topics and gives an overview of life and equality gaps in the 1960s. The cast picks and acting are wonderful. As well, the music is another large comfort component of this movie. </p>
