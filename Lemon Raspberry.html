		Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour,
1/2 cup sugar,
2 teaspoons baking powder,
1/2 teaspoon baking soda,
1/2 teaspoon salt,
2 large eggs, room temperature, lightly beaten,
1 cup lemon yogurt,
1/2 cup vegetable oil,
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest,
1 cup fresh or frozen raspberries.
Topping:
1/3 cup sugar,
1/4 cup all-purpose flour,
2 tablespoons butter or margarine.

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Combine eggs, yogurt, oil and lemon zest; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in raspberries. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. For topping, combine sugar and flour. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle about 1 tablespoon over each muffin. Bake at 400Â° for 18-20 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
