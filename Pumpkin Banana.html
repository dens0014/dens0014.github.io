		Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour,
1 cup whole wheat flour,
2/3 cup packed brown sugar,
1 teaspoon baking soda,
1 teaspoon salt,
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon,
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger,
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice,
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg,
2 large eggs, room temperature,
1 cup canned pumpkin,
1/2 cup mashed ripe bananas (about 2 small),
1/3 cup buttermilk,
1/4 cup canola oil,
2 teaspoons vanilla extract.

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first 9 ingredients. In another bowl, combine the eggs, pumpkin, bananas, buttermilk, oil and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.
Coat muffin cups with cooking spray; fill three-fourths full with batter. Bake at 400Â° for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in muffin comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Serve warm.
