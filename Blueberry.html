	<p>Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter softened,
1/3 cup sugar,
1 large egg, room temperature,
2-1/3 cups all-purpose flour,
4 teaspoons baking powder,
1/2 teaspoon salt,
1 cup 2% milk,
1 teaspoon vanilla extract,
1-1/2 cups fresh or frozen wild blueberries or 1 can (15 ounces) water-packed wild blueberries, well drained.

Streusel topping:
1/2 cup sugar,
1/3 cup all-purpose flour,
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon,
1/4 cup cold butter, cubed.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°. In a bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add egg; mix well. Combine dry ingredients; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk. Stir in vanilla. Gently fold in blueberries.
Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. For streusel topping, in a small bowl, combine the sugar, flour and cinnamon; cut in the butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over muffins. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 20-25 minutes.
